# Mod 1 Week 5 Assessment

## Questions (10 Points Possible)
1. What would happen if you try to use a variable that is not in scope?
That variable wouldn't work because in the program, it does not exist outside of the scope.
2. Describe the three As of a test:  
A -  Arrange- this is the part of your code that you need to set it up the test 
A -  Act- this is the method we are executing to test(can be located in the Assert) 
A -  Assert- this is where we test to the method 

3. What is the difference between `public` and `private` access modifiers?
Public access modifiers allow methods and classes to be used outside of their own class while private access modifiers can only be used within the class they were built.
4. A method should:  (**Select all that apply**) <br/>
(A) Make changes to an object  <<<<<<<
(B) Return some information about an object  <<<<<<< 
(C) Make changes to an object and return information about the object. <<<<<<< 
(D) None of the Above.  


5. How did you determine what to answer for the question above?
A method can be either be a query(give information) or commmand(change information) method. It can be both but refactoring of that method would be recommended :)
## Exercise (10 Points Possible)

Clone your forked copy of this repository into Visual Studio.  

In this solution, there is a User project with a single User class.  The class works, but it needs some additional effort to be great! One thing that is missing is tests; your job is to write the tests that will confirm the functionality of the class. Write one test for the constructor, and at least one test for each of the other 4 methods. As you write the tests, you might find some refactoring opportunities; update the user class with any refactors you deem necessary and add a comment describing why you made that refactor.  The only rule is that all the existing methods must still exist when you are finished!


## Submission
